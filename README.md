This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that animates the title of any note you open by scrambling and revealing it in several visually appealing ways. 

I noticed this effect in a couple of places, and I personally find it wonderful. The last push was when I recently finished watching Aldnoah.Zero and then visited their website https://www.aldnoahzerousa.com/. IT'S SO PRETTY, I LOVE THE LOGIN SCREEN AND THE SCRAMBLING EFFECT ON THE TEXT, MWAH, CHEF'S KISS. I was thinking of eventually putting the effect somewhere on my personal website \
2nd season wasn't so bad

## Usage
The default settings should be sensible as-is, so you might be done as soon as you download and enable it. Just open a new note and check if the title changes \
